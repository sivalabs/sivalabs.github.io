      <description>Happy new year to you :-) I don&amp;rsquo;t really believe in new year resolutions or making big 5 year plans!! But I do realize that by making a list of things that I want to do keeps me focus on those things and minimize the distractions.
Before going to talk about my grand plans for 2018 let me take moment and see how was my 2017.
What I did in 2017  I wrote a new book Beginning Spring Boot 2 with Apress publishers I learned a lot of good practices at ThoughtWorks I gave a conference talk on MicroServices at DevConHyd 2017 Conference I gave a GeekNight talk on Cloud Native Applications using SpringBoot and Spring Cloud I quit my job to start my own consulting gig Learned to Say NO  The year 2017 is a wonderful year for me in many ways.</description>
